**Title:** Next-Week Risk Classification of Dow Jones Stocks Using Machine Learning  
**Date:** Sat Dec 6, 2025

## 2. Dataset Selection
I am using the Dow Jones Index Weekly Stock Dataset, originally released by Brown, Pelosi, and Dirska (2013). The dataset contains 750 weekly records of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) component stocks, with 16 attributes describing price movement, volume, dividend details, and next-week performance.
